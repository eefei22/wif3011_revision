/*
 * A bank account allows different users to perform deposit 
 * or withdrawal at the same time. This requires the update 
 * of account balance to be properly controlled, or otherwise, 
 * error may occur. For example, if two deposits are performed 
 * concurrently, the accountâ€™s balance must be the sum of existing
 * balance and the two deposits. Write a Java program that allows 
 * multiple deposits/withdrawals to be performed as threads. 
 * Provide a control mechanism to ensure the account balance is 
 * always correct.
