/*  Write a Java program to simulate a room cleaning scenario using 
    thread synchronization. The rules are as follows:
    -   Cleaners can enter the room only when no guests are present, 
        and only one cleaner is allowed in the room at a time. 
        If the room is occupied (by any guests), a cleaner must wait until 
        it becomes available.
    -   Guests can enter the room only when no cleaner is inside, and up to 6 
        guests can be in the room simultaneously. If a cleaner is inside or if 
        the room already has 6 guests, a guest must wait before entering.
    Implement this simulation using Javaâ€™s built-in synchronization 
    constructs (synchronized, wait(), and notifyAll() or notify()).
